After successfully running our first test case on Firefox Browser now we are stepping towards grasping the essential Browser Navigation Commands in Selenium. Thus we are going to discuss about various navigation commands that we would be using in our day to day automation testing. The navigate interface exposes the ability to move backwards and forwards in the browser’s history.
To access the navigation’s method, just type driver.navigate()..

# "Navigate To" Command
```
driver.navigate().to("http://www.DemoQA.com");
```

# "Forward" Command
```
driver.navigate().forward();
```

# "Back" Command
```
driver.navigate().back();
```

# "Refresh" Command
```
driver.navigate().refresh();
```
